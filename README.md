# XcodeTargetGraphGen

XcodeTargetGraphGen is a Swift command line tool that analyzes .xcodeproj files to generate a visualization of module-level internal dependencies using Mermaid diagram syntax. It supports multiple package managers, providing a clear representation of the structure and dependencies in Xcode projects across various environments. This facilitates a deeper understanding of the organization of modules in complex projects.
