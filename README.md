# XcodeTargetGraphGen

XcodeTargetGraphGen is an open-source tool that helps you visualize the internal dependencies of your Xcode projects. It takes an .xcodeproj file and generates a dependency graph using the Mermaid diagram syntax. This can be incredibly useful for understanding the structure and dependencies of large and complex Xcode projects.
